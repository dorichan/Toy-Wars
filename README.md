#### PROJECT INFORMATION ####
Unity Version: 5.3.2p3

Top down (isometric) strategy game with tower defense elements. This is a personal project, so any work on this will be done on my own time and on my own personal machine. I hope to utilize my own art assets as much as possible in order to better learn the art pipeline for the Unity engine. Also, will make an effort to utilize some programming techniques that I don't get to normally use / haven't used at all yet professionally or personally.

#### INSTRUCTIONS ####
Nothing too complicated for now. I will be building out .exe files for testing. Will move on to a web / mobile build in the future probably.

#### GOALS ####
- Build a stable Windows version of the game with at least three different levels.
- Add three separate levels to each individual unit with unique art each.
- Add social media integration to, at least, Facebook or Instagram where you can post your high scores or pictures w/ captions.
- Eventually port to mobile or web.
- Integrate Sphero control for fun haha :metal:
